# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

resources:
  repositories:
  # a build repository (we can have many)
  - repository: slave
    type: github
    endpoint: dave-yotta
    name: dave-yotta/yaml-slave-repo

      branches:
        include:
        - master
